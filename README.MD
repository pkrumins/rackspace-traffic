Rackspace invoices don't provide outgoing bandwidth breakdown by servers. They've just a single position describing total outgoing bandwidth. This program parses the invoice CSV and reports bandwidth usage by servers.

Usage:

    perl rackspace-traffic.pl <csv file>

You can find the CSV file if you go to Billing and Payments, and then click on an invoice number.
